# Gift Shop Invalid IDs – Part 1

Finds the sum of invalid product IDs in a gift shop.  
An ID is invalid if it consists of a block of digits repeated **exactly twice** (no leading zeros).  
Input: `input.txt` with comma-separated ranges like `11-22,95-115,...`.  
The program efficiently generates candidate numbers and sums those that fall within the ranges.
