# Gift Shop Invalid IDs – Part 2

Calculates the sum of product IDs that are considered invalid.  
An ID is invalid if it is made of a sequence of digits repeated **at least twice** (leading zeros are not allowed).  
Input: `input.txt` containing comma-separated ranges like `11-22,95-115,...`.  
The program examines each number in the ranges for repeated patterns and totals the invalid IDs.
